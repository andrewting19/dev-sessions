# TODO — dev-sessions

## Completed

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- [x] TypeScript project scaffolding (package.json, tsconfig, vitest, build scripts)
- [x] Champion ID generation (LoL champion + role, e.g., `fizz-top`)
- [x] Session store (JSON file at `~/.dev-sessions/sessions.json`)
- [x] CLI skeleton with commander.js (all commands wired)

### Phase 2: Claude Code Backend ✅
- [x] `create` — tmux + `claude --session-id <uuid> --dangerously-skip-permissions`
- [x] `send` — base64-encoded tmux send-keys with CLI running verification
- [x] `kill`, `list` with dead session pruning
- [x] Transcript parsing: `~/.claude/projects/<sanitized-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl`
- [x] `last-message` — extract assistant text blocks from JSONL
- [x] `status` — infer idle/working/waiting_for_input (system-entry-aware)
- [x] `wait` — system-entry-based turn detection (reliable after 3 iterations of fixes)
- [x] `create` race fix — polls for transcript file existence before returning, so a fast `send` after `create` doesn't type into an unready TUI

### Phase 2b: Docker Gateway ✅
- [x] Thin HTTP relay gateway (`dev-sessions gateway --port <port>`)
- [x] CLI auto-detection: `DEV_SESSIONS_SANDBOX=1` → route through gateway
- [x] `HOST_PATH` mapping for transcript resolution
- [x] Fail fast when sandbox `/workspace` paths cannot be translated because `HOST_PATH` is missing
- [x] Gateway as subcommand (no separate install needed)
- [x] Gateway binary resolution — resolves path from `process.argv[1]`
- [x] Gateway request logging — requests logged for easier Docker debugging
- [x] Error message when gateway unreachable — includes URL + hint
- [x] Gateway binds to `127.0.0.1` only (security — was binding to all interfaces)
- [x] Real Docker E2E verified — all three paths:
  - Docker → Codex on host
  - Docker → Claude on host
  - Docker → Claude in Docker (`--mode docker`)

### Phase 3: Codex Backend ✅
- [x] Persistent `codex app-server` daemon (WebSocket, JSON-RPC 2.0)
- [x] One daemon, many threads — conversation continuity across sends
- [x] `create` auto-starts daemon if not running, calls `thread/start`
- [x] `send` connects via WebSocket, calls `turn/start`, waits for `turn/completed`
- [x] `wait`, `last-message`, `status` all work
- [x] `kill` archives thread, stops daemon when last Codex session killed
- [x] Daemon metadata at `~/.dev-sessions/codex-appserver.json`
- [x] `last-message` reads from `thread/read` RPC — persisted history across process restarts
- [x] `status`/`wait` reconcile with live app-server state via `thread/resume` — no longer trust stale store cache
- [x] `sessionExists()` verifies specific thread ID via `thread/list` — not just daemon liveness
- [x] Overlap guard — rejects `send` if `codexTurnInProgress` is already true, with clear error
- [x] `extractThreadRuntimeStatus` fixed — correctly parses Codex `ThreadStatus` enum JSON shape
- [x] Stale `lastTurnStatus: 'failed'` in store now reconciled against live thread before throwing
- [x] Fast-capture only returns `assistantText` when the early wait actually completes (not on timeout/partial deltas)
- [x] P0 fixes: timeout no longer poisons store with `interrupted`; `status()` always does live check against app-server; non-Error throws always trigger send cleanup
- [x] Codex `wait` now waits through multi-turn progress updates (loops until thread quiescence), scopes `turn/completed` to the target thread, and live-rechecks status when store state is stale
- [x] Codex `send`/`wait` now track the exact `turnId` from `turn/start`, so `wait` blocks on that turn's `turn/completed` notification instead of trusting false `thread/resume` idle/completed states during long tool execution on Codex 0.104.0
- [x] Codex exact-turn `wait` now reconciles `turn/completed` against `thread/read` before returning, which fixes false early completion on reconnect and lets `wait` recover when the completion notification was missed but the target turn is already terminal
- [x] Remove `yolo` mode — `native` is now always permissive (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`)

### Phase 4: Skills & Install ✅
- [x] `skills/` directory — multi-skill bundle (dev-sessions + handoff)
- [x] `install-skill` installs all skills at once (`--global`/`--local`, `--claude`/`--codex`, auto-detect)
- [x] `handoff` skill ported from claude-ting MCP → CLI

### Phase 5: Gateway Daemon ✅
- [x] `gateway install` — installs as macOS launchd service or Linux systemd unit
- [x] `gateway uninstall` — removes daemon and stops it
- [x] `gateway status` — shows whether daemon is running and on which port
- [x] Auto-starts on login; no manual `dev-sessions gateway` needed
- [x] Resolves node binary via `process.execPath` so launchd/systemd find it regardless of PATH/NVM

### clauded/Docker Integration ✅
- [x] `dev-sessions` CLI in `claude-ting/Dockerfile.ubuntu-dev`
- [x] `claude-docker` in zshrc passes `DEV_SESSIONS_GATEWAY_URL`
- [x] `~/.local/bin/clauded` wrapper script (was zsh-only function)
- [x] dev-sessions MCP stripped from claude-ting Dockerfile — CLI-based approach only
- [x] claude-ting docs updated with host setup instructions (gateway install, install-skill)

### Testing ✅
- [x] 126 automated tests (unit + integration) across 17 test files
- [x] Real E2E verified: Claude Code send→wait→last-message
- [x] Real E2E verified: Codex send→wait→last-message (PONG test)
- [x] Real E2E verified: Docker gateway relay

### Phase 6: Codex 0.139.0 + Goals ✅
- [x] Verified against codex-cli 0.139.0 (latest as of 2026-06-09) — live E2E: create/send/wait/last-message/status/logs/kill, including tool-executing turns
- [x] **Model default removed** — `gpt-5.3-codex` was hardcoded and is now rejected by the API (400 on ChatGPT accounts), silently breaking every new session. `model` is omitted from `thread/start`/`thread/resume` unless `create --model` is passed; legacy stored `gpt-5.3-codex` is dropped on send
- [x] `create --model <m>` flag
- [x] **Goal support** (Codex `/goal`, stable since 0.133.0): `goal <id> [objective] [--budget N] [--pause|--resume|--clear] [--json]` via `thread/goal/set|get|clear`; setting an objective implies `status: active` (otherwise a completed goal stays complete and nothing runs)
- [x] `wait <id> --goal` — blocks until the goal reaches a terminal state (complete/paused/blocked/usageLimited/budgetLimited); prints the status; exit 124 on timeout
- [x] `ask <id> <msg>` — one-shot send + wait + print-reply round trip
- [x] Gateway routes for goal (`GET/POST /goal`, `GET /wait?goal=1`) + gateway client methods
- [x] **Failed turns surface real errors** — `error` notifications (e.g. invalid model 400s) are captured live and used when `turn/completed` lacks detail; reconnecting `wait` detects the silent-failure pattern (turn persisted `completed` with no output + thread `systemError`) and reports failure with the thread error detail
- [x] tmux `sessionExists` treats "no server running" as `dead` (was `unknown`, which blocked pruning when the killed session was the last one on the server)
- [x] Live goal E2E: set → autonomous turn → complete; pause/resume/clear; second objective reactivates
- [x] `/tmp/codex` re-pinned to `rust-v0.139.0`

### Phase 8: In-container goal verification ✅
- [x] **Gateway `/goal` flag reconstruction fixed** — the CLI sends `status: 'active'` with every objective (objective implies active); the gateway re-encoded that as `--resume`, which the host CLI rejects alongside an objective. The route now drops the redundant `active` and 400s on `paused`+objective
- [x] **Goal ops work on fresh threads** — goal set/get/clear and `wait --next-turn` did `thread/resume` first, which fails with "no rollout found" on a thread that hasn't run its first turn yet (rollout file doesn't exist until then, even though the thread is live in the daemon). Resume is now tolerant of exactly that error
- [x] Full in-container E2E (real ubuntu-dev container → gateway → host): create codex session, goal set → autonomous completion → `wait --goal`, `ask` with multi-paragraph reply preserved, pause/resume/clear, `wait --next-turn` timeout semantics, kill

### Phase 7: Orchestration polish ✅
- [x] `wait <id> --next-turn` — single-shot turn-boundary wait (returns on the next `turn/completed`, including server-initiated goal continuation turns; plain `wait` loops to quiescence and rides through goal turns because continuations fire synchronously on thread-idle)
- [x] `last-message --json` + gateway uses it — fixes the gateway block-splitting corruption (messages with paragraph breaks were split on blank lines)
- [x] `kill --all` and `kill --older-than <30m|72h|7d>` — bulk cleanup of stale sessions, works through the gateway (CLI-level list+kill)

### Phase 9: Remote host support (SSH) ✅
- [x] `create --host <ssh-target>` — session spawns on the remote; all other commands route automatically via the local registry (`host` + `remoteBin` stored per session)
- [x] Transport: `ssh <host> bash -lc '<remoteBin> <cmd> --json'` with ControlMaster multiplexing (60s persist), `BatchMode=yes`, `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new`, `ConnectTimeout=10`, ServerAlive keepalives — `src/remote/ssh-runner.ts`
- [x] `RemoteHostClient` (per-command builders/parsers) + `RoutingSessionManager` (implements `SessionManagerLike`, routes by `session.host`) — same seam as the gateway client
- [x] Champion IDs pre-allocated locally and passed via `create --id`, so IDs stay unique across hosts; retries if the ID is taken remotely
- [x] Version handshake at `create --host` — warns (stderr) when remote major.minor differs, continues
- [x] `send`/`ask --file` content streams over ssh **stdin** (`send <id> --file -`), never argv — no scp temp files, arbitrary quoting/size safe
- [x] `list` shows HOST column, merges live remote state, prunes stubs whose remote session died, keeps cached stubs (with warning) when a host is unreachable
- [x] Exit codes preserved through the relay (wait timeout 124 verified live); SSH transport failure exits **255** (distinct from session failure)
- [x] Durability: session + goal driver run detached on the remote; verified live that killing the ControlMaster mid-turn doesn't touch the session and `wait` reattaches
- [x] Gateway `/create` accepts `host` so Docker-sandboxed agents can target remote hosts (host-side routing does the rest)
- [x] New machine-readable surface for the relay: `create --json`, `create --id`, `logs --json`; `--version` no longer double-prints
- [x] Verified E2E against a real Ubuntu host over real ssh: create/list/send/status/wait/last-message/logs/inspect/ask/kill, hostile-quoting round trip, out-of-band kill pruning, version-mismatch warning, unreachable-host exit 255
- [ ] Remote codex goal flow not live-tested (relay mechanics covered by unit tests; local goal E2E exists from Phase 6)

## Known Issues (open)

- [ ] **Codex ignores `--mode` flag** — `approvalPolicy` and `sandbox` are hardcoded to `never`/`danger-full-access` regardless of mode. Low priority since native mode always uses permissive settings.
- [ ] **No `respond`/`approve` command** — when a session hits `waiting_for_input`, the orchestrator has no structured way to respond. Only matters for non-native modes.
- [ ] **Claude permission prompts undetectable** — TUI elements, not in JSONL transcript. `status` reports `working` instead of `waiting_for_input`. Only affects `native` mode.
- [x] **Codex `last-message` returns empty** — fixed: `waitForTurnCompletion` now includes `assistantText` in result; `wait` persists it to `lastAssistantMessages` in the store.
- [x] **Gateway `last-message` block splitting** — fixed: `last-message --json` prints a lossless JSON block array and the gateway route uses it.

## Remaining Work

### High Priority

#### ~~Make `send` non-blocking~~ ✅
`send` now returns immediately after `turn/start` is accepted (Codex) or after tmux send-keys (Claude). `wait` is the dedicated blocking primitive. Overlap guard removed — app-server queues turns naturally.

#### ~~Tmux tri-state liveness (#6)~~ ✅
`sessionExists()` returns `'alive' | 'dead' | 'unknown'`. `listSessions()` only prunes on `'dead'`; `'unknown'` preserves the session record.

### Medium Priority

#### ~~Session store locking (#2/#3)~~ ✅
File-based locking added to `SessionStore` via atomic `mkdir` lock primitive. All read-modify-write operations (`upsertSession`, `updateSession`, `deleteSession`, `pruneSessions`) are serialized through `withLock()`. Stale lock recovery (30s timeout) prevents deadlocks from crashed processes. Concurrency tests added covering parallel upserts, deletes, updates, mixed operations, and cross-instance access.

#### Orphaned resources on store failure (#8)
**Why:** External resources (tmux session, Codex thread) are created before store persistence. If `upsertSession()` fails, the session/thread is created but untracked — orphaned forever.
**What:** On store write failure, do best-effort rollback (kill tmux session or archive Codex thread) before returning error.
**Files:** `src/session-manager.ts` (create path), `src/backends/claude-tmux.ts`, `src/backends/codex-appserver.ts`

#### Codex daemon concurrent startup (#9)
**Why:** Two concurrent `create` calls can both decide the daemon isn't running and both try to spawn it, resulting in two daemons. Also, if startup checks fail after spawn, the child process is orphaned.
**What:** Add a startup lockfile before spawning. Use unique temp state files. Kill the spawned child on startup failure before throwing.
**Files:** `src/backends/codex-appserver.ts` (daemon startup path)

#### Codex status truthfulness via app-server notification monitor (new)
**Why:** On codex-cli `0.104.0`, `thread/resume` and even `thread/read` can report an idle/completed thread while the agent is still executing tools in the same turn. We now mitigate `wait` and `status` by persisting `codexActiveTurnId`, but `status` remains conservative and can stay `working` after out-of-band completion until `wait` or another completion path clears the latch.
**What:** Build a long-lived local monitor (daemon task or companion process) that subscribes to Codex app-server notifications and updates the session store from `turn/started` / `turn/completed` events for tracked threads. Use the existing app-server as source of truth; the monitor just persists a projection into `~/.dev-sessions/sessions.json` (or future SQLite store).
**Protocol signals to use (0.104.0):**
- `turn/started` → persist `codexTurnInProgress=true`, `codexActiveTurnId=<turn.id>`
- `turn/completed` (matching thread + turn) → persist `codexTurnInProgress=false`, clear `codexActiveTurnId`, persist `lastTurnStatus`/`lastTurnError`, update `codexLastCompletedAt`
- `item/agentMessage/delta` (optional) → capture streamed text for better `last-message` freshness if desired
**Non-goals for v1 monitor:**
- Do not infer completion from `thread/resume` or `thread/read`
- Do not try to reconstruct missed notifications after the monitor was offline (best-effort only)
**Suggested design:**
- Single monitor connection per app-server (not per session)
- Subscribe by `thread/resume` for active tracked threads; maintain mapping `threadId -> championId`
- Reconcile tracked threads periodically from store (or via `create`/`send` hooks) so newly created sessions get subscribed
- Gracefully handle daemon restarts / websocket reconnects; resubscribe all tracked threads on reconnect
- Keep updates idempotent (ignore duplicate notifications)
**Success criteria (verifiable):**
1. Reproduce the timed-command false-idle bug on Codex `0.104.0` and confirm `dev-sessions status <id>` stays `working` during the 8s command even when `thread/resume` reports idle.
2. After the final `turn/completed`, `dev-sessions status <id>` flips to `idle` without requiring `dev-sessions wait`.
3. Out-of-band completion (agent finishes while no `wait` is running) clears `codexActiveTurnId` automatically.
4. Monitor survives app-server restart: after reconnect + resubscribe, new turns update status correctly.
5. Duplicate `turn/completed` notifications (or reconnect replay artifacts if any) do not corrupt store state.
**Files (likely):**
- `src/backends/codex-appserver.ts` (notification client reuse / subscription helpers)
- `src/session-manager.ts` or new monitor module (lifecycle wiring)
- `src/session-store.ts` (event-driven updates; later SQLite integration)
- `tests/integration/` (real Codex repro asserting status transitions without `wait`)

### Architecture

#### ~~Backend adapter interface (#13)~~ ✅
`Backend` interface defined in `src/backends/backend.ts`. `ClaudeBackend` and `CodexBackend` adapters in `src/backends/claude-backend.ts` and `src/backends/codex-backend.ts`. `SessionManager` now routes through a `Map<SessionCli, Backend>` with no `if (session.cli === 'codex')` branches. All 123 tests pass.

### Polish
- [ ] `send --file` with template variables (inject session context)
- [ ] `wait` with multiple session IDs (wait for all/any)
- [ ] Auto-cleanup: kill sessions older than N hours
- [x] `logs` command — full transcript dump with role labels (Claude: JSONL parse; Codex: thread/read)
- [x] `inspect` command — dump raw stored session record as JSON
- [ ] Better error messages throughout (session not found, tmux not installed, codex not installed)
- [x] Reject nonexistent workspace paths up front instead of creating broken sessions
- [ ] Version strings — source from `package.json` in one place (currently duplicated in cli.ts and codex clientInfo)

### Future

#### Replace Claude tmux backend with `--sdk-url` WebSocket protocol
**Why:** `claude-tmux.ts` is the most brittle part of the system — tmux send-keys with base64 encoding, hardcoded sleep delays, JSONL transcript polling, ps-based liveness detection. All replaceable.

**How:** Claude Code accepts `--sdk-url ws://HOST:PORT/PATH`. The CLI connects back as a WebSocket client and speaks NDJSON. Messages include `system/init`, `assistant` (streaming), `result` (turn complete with cost/tokens/stop reason), and `control_request` (auto-approve). Server sends `user` (prompt), `control_response`, and `control_request/interrupt`. This gives push-based status, structured turn results, prompt queuing, and interrupt support — no tmux, no transcript parsing, no polling.

**Quirk:** CLI waits for a `user` message BEFORE sending `system/init`. Must send queued prompt on WebSocket open before waiting for init.

**Reference:** `andrewting19/cc-api` — single-file Bun implementation of this protocol (~500 LOC). Demonstrates full session lifecycle. Would need porting from Bun to Node (`ws` package), stripping the OpenClaw callback, and wiring into existing `Backend` interface + `SessionStore`.

**Replaces:** `claude-tmux.ts`, `transcript/claude-parser.ts`, transcript-based `wait` logic.
**Risk:** `--sdk-url` is undocumented. Keep tmux backend as fallback initially.

- [ ] Session groups (named collections for fan-out workflows)
- [ ] Codex Docker support (`codexed` + tmux + transcript parsing) — P2
- [ ] Mid-turn steerability — explicit `send --interrupt` or `send --queue` flags once `send` is non-blocking
